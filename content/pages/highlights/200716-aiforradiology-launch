More than 100 artificial intelligence products for radiology are already commercially available. With such a supply, what should you choose to buy and implement as a radiology department? Navigating the market, including products with different goals, levels of certification, and evidence, is not easy. To encourage clinical implementation of AI, we believe creating transparency of the market is key. Therefore, we have developed and maintain http://www.aiforradiology.com: a website providing an overview of AI CE-marked software for radiology. This is an independent, academic effort from the Radiology Department of the Radboud university medical center. Many vendors have already provided us with detailed product specifications making it easier for radiology departments to perform market analysis and discover what could suit their clinical context. The website will be expanded with more functionalities and practical guides for implementation over time. We hope this will be a useful resource for radiologists worldwide encouraging AI adoption.
