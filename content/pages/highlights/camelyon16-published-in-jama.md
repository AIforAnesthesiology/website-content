The Diagnostic Image Analysis Group organized CAMELYON16, the first medical image analysis challenge with whole slide digital pathology images in 2016. The competition was a great success, and several of the submitted software solutions outperformed human pathologists in the detection of lymph node metastases. The results of Camelyon16 were published in JAMA and covered by the national Dutch television show Nieuwsuur.
