The [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en) granted [member/francesco-ciompi] of the [Computational Pathology group](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/) a prestigious [VIDI-TTW grant](https://www.nwo.nl/calls/nwo-talentprogramma-vidi-toegepaste-en-technische-wetenschappen-ttw) of 800,000 euro for his project "<i>Predicting Lung Cancer Immunotherapy Response. It's personal</i>". 

Immunotherapy involving so-called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is a Nobel prize-winning approach to cure cancer. Disrupting the mechanisms that tumors develop to inactivate immune cells and unleashing them to eradicate cancer, ICI have led to unprecedented responses in previously untreatable cancers, including the deadliest one: non small cell lung cancer. Unfortunately only <20% of patients respond to immunotherapy, while the vast majority is exposed to drug toxicity without therapeutic effect at a yearly cost of >100,000 Euro/patient. Current guidelines select patients eligible for ICI based on visual histological assessment of PD-L1, but only a fraction of selected patients eventually respond, and clinical trials have shown that some of the untreated patients would eventually respond to the treatment. This clearly shows that a better selection method is required.

In this project, [member/francesco-ciompi] is going to develop artificial intelligence methods to design digital biomarkers to predict immunotherapy treatment response for lung cancer, based on the analysis of multiple immunohistochemical markers of digitized histopathology tissue biopsies.

The project will be developed in close collaboration with clinical partners at regional ([Radboudumc](https://www.radboudumc.nl/patientenzorg), [Maasziekenhuis Pantein](https://www.maasziekenhuispantein.nl/), [CWZ](https://www.cwz.nl/), [Elkerliek](https://www.elkerliek.nl/Elkerliek)), national ([Nederlands Kanker Instituut](https://www.nki.nl/), [Utrecht UMC](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/nl)) and international ([Cannizzaro Hospital](https://www.aocannizzaro.it/utente/reparti-e-servizi/anatomia-patologica/), Italy) level, and with an industrial partner ([SECTRA](https://medical.sectra.com/product/sectra-digital-pathology-solution/)) leader in digital pathology solutions. The goal is to investigate, design and validate digital biomarkers of immunotherapy treatment response, and eventually make them available in the clinic to improve the way lung cancer patients are treated with immunotherapy.
