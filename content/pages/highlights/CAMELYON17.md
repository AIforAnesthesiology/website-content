[Peter Bandi](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/members/peter-bandi/) and [Oscar Geessink](https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/members/oscar-geessink/), organizers of [CAMELYON17](https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/), challenged participants to move from individual metastases detection ([CAMELYON16](https://camelyon16.grand-challenge.org/)) to classification of lymph node status on a patient level. Over 300 participants registered on the challenge website, of which 23 teams submitted a total of 37 algorithms before the deadline. The algorithmic details of the top-twelve best submissions are discussed in the paper that was accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging last August. Read [here](http://diagnijmegen.nl/index.php/Publication?bibkey=Band18) which architecture and methodology led to the best results and what pushed the highest kappa value from 0.89 to 0.93.
