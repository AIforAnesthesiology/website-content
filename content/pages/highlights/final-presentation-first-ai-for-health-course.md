Friday, September 25, 2020, the first AI for Health course concluded with a meeting where all participants presented the results of their AI projects. About 25 Radboudumc employees from different backgrounds followed the first course. [The second edition](https://www.ai-for-health.nl/courses/) has now started and will run until February 2021. That month, the third edition is scheduled to commence, and if you are interested, you can already send an e-mail to aiforhealth@radboudumc.nl.

Radboudumc organizes the 16-day course together with the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science ([JADS](https://www.jads.nl/)) in Den Bosch. As part of the course, teams of particpants perform an AI project. The presentations of these projects demonstrated the diversity of AI applications in healthcare. 

Esmee Bakker and Yonne Peters presented **Electronic nose device: detection of colorectal cancer through exhaled breath using a non-invasive screening tool**. Electronic noses analyze volatile organic compounds in air, in this case air breathed out by people suspected of colorectal cancer. These e-noses are becoming cheaper, easier to use, and equiped with more sophisticated sensors. They applied different machine learning approaches to the e-nose measurements, but concluded that the performance was not yet good enough to consider integrating this in the colorectal cancer screening in The Netherlands.  

Sabine van den Akker, Tessel Galesloot, Luc Evers, Ruud van Kaam and Tim Frenzel described their work on **Predicting re-intubation in critically ill patients**. Many patients in ICU where intubation is ended need to be re-intubated at a later point in tima. Predicting the necessity for re-intubation may lead to better patient management. The team showed that data collection at the ICU is challenging and careful data cleaning is needed before machine learning can be applied. 

Ilse Spenkelink, Tom Perik, Loes van der Zanden, Gerben Lassche and Chris de Korte worked with deep learning techniques for image classification in **AI for classification of breast cancer in 3D ultrasound data**. Building upon standard 2D comnvolutional networks, they developed a pipeline to classify 3D ultrasound patches. 

Lisa Hofste, Pascal van Nispen, Milou Schuurbiers and Janet Vos presented **Fragmentomics**. The team requested all data from a recent
