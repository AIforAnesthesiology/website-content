Friday, September 25, 2020, the first AI for Health course concluded with a meeting where all participants presented the results of their AI projects. About 25 Radboudumc employees from different backgrounds followed the first course. [The second edition](https://www.ai-for-health.nl/courses/) has now started and will run until February 2021. That month, the third edition is scheduled to commence, and if you are interested, you can already send an e-mail to aiforhealth@radboudumc.nl.

Radboudumc organizes the 16-day course together with the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science ([JADS](https://www.jads.nl/)) in Den Bosch. As part of the course, teams of particpants perform an AI project. The presentations of these projects demonstrated the diversity of AI applications in healthcare. 

Esmee Bakker and Yonne Peters presented **Electronic nose device: detection of colorectal cancer through exhaled breath using a non-invasive screening tool**. Electronic noses analyze volatile organic compounds in air, in this case air breathed out by people suspected of colorectal cancer. These e-noses are becoming cheaper, easier to use, and equiped with more sophisticated sensors. They applied different machine learning approaches to the e-nose measurements, but concluded that the performance was not yet good enough to consider integrating this in the colorectal cancer screening in The Netherlands.  

Sabine van den Akker, Tessel Galesloot, Luc Evers, Ruud van Kaam and Tim Frenzel described their work on **Predicting re-intubation in critically ill patients**. Many patients in ICU where intubation is ended need to be re-intubated at a later point in time. Predicting the necessity for re-intubation may lead to better patient management. The team showed that data collection at the ICU is challenging and careful data cleaning is needed before machine learning can be applied. 

Ilse Spenkelink, Tom Perik, Loes van der Zanden, Gerben Lassche and Chris de Korte worked with deep learning techniques for image classification in **AI for classification of breast cancer in 3D ultrasound data**. Building upon standard 2D convolutional networks, they developed a pipeline to classify 3D ultrasound patches. 

Lisa Hofste, Pascal van Nispen, Milou Schuurbiers and Janet Vos presented **Fragmentomics**. The team requested all data from a recent Nature publication in which different types of cancer were diagnosed based on cancer cell-free DNA present in the blood. The reproduced the machine learning experiments in the paper and showed that with different classifiers even slightly better performance could be achieved.  

Amon Heijne, Daan de Jong, Daphne Everaerd and Laurens Verscheijden reported on **Electroconvulsive therapy: predicting the seizure**. Patients who receive this treatment undergo multiple session and the choosing the right settings for each session is difficult. The team analyzed if it is possible to better predict the optimal setting based on data from the previous settings. They concluded that the results obtained so far were not yet good enough, but additional clinical features that are also available could be added in order to improve the predictions.  

Finally, Lex Dingemans, Tom Loonen, Anouk van der Schot and Mirjam Schaap addressed **Automated clinical scoring in psoriasis**. The severity of disease in psoriasis patients is often quqntified with the PASI score. The team presented the first steps towards automatically assessing one aspect of this score from photographs using deep convolutional neural networks. Mirjam Schaap also recently received a [Radboud AI Voucher](https://www.ru.nl/ai/news-events/news/vm-eigen-news/five-winners-first-round-radboud-ai-innovation/) to continue this research.

Joran Lokkerbol, who led the AI for Health course handed out certificates to all course participants, with a special recipe box to make your own Bossche Bol.
