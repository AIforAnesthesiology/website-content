Freerk Venhuizen has been awarded the title of Doctor by the Radboud University of Nijmegen after defending his PhD thesis, titled "Machine Learning for Quantification of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Imaging Biomarkers in Optical Coherence Tomography".

Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most important cause of severe vision loss in the elderly. With the rapid growth of the aging population, the estimated number of people suffering from AMD is 196 million in 2020. As AMD is a disease that requires frequent treatment, it causes a substantial burden on the patient and on the health care system. We therefore need to work towards more efficient treatment procedures, treatment monitoring, and diagnostic tools. In this thesis an effort is made to improve patient care and reduce the burden on the health care system by providing tools aimed at automating various tasks in the field of ophthalmology.
