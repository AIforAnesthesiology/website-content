For the third edition of the AI for Health course, starting 12 February 2021, the registration has opened. The third edition will run from February until July 2021.

A summary of the course:

- The course will be held on 14 Fridays, with different topics per day.
- The course days consist of lectures in the morning and afternoon practicals with cases focused on Radboudumc practice.
- The program for the 14 Fridays will mostly be held at Radboudumc in Nijmegen and a few times at JADS in Den Bosch.
- In addition there will be 4 project days, also on Fridays, in the Radboudumc where you will work in a team on a Radboudumc project.
- We expect participants to spend on average 4 hours per week on homework and self study.
- There will be an online training environment with support documentation, discussion forum and blended learning.
- The course will end with a graduation ceremony where teams will present their project results and a certificate will be awarded.
- The costs of the course will be funded by Radboudumc. If the employee who follows the course leaves the Radboudumc within 2 years after graduating the course, a refund scheme is in place (CAO article 3.1.3). The head of the department has to support the application for the course.
