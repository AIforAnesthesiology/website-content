DIAG develops algorithms for the analysis of medical images. Compared to other research groups in this field, we put a lot of focus on facilitating the application of these algorithms in clinical practice and clinical research. For this, we are developing a workstation platform that can be used throughout DIAG, called CIRRUS. Based on this platform, different workstations are being developed for, such as CIRRUS Lung Screening and CIRRUS Oncology.
The workstation is based on the MeVisLab software platform and is available through research collaboration agreements.
