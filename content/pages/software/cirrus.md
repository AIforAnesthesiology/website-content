DIAG develops algorithms for the analysis of medical images. Compared to other research groups in this field, we put a lot of focus on facilitating the application of these algorithms in clinical practice and clinical research. For this, we are developing a workstation platform that can be used throughout DIAG, called CIRRUS.
