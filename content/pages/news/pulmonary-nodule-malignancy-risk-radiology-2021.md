[Kiran Vaidhya Venkadesh](member/kiran-vaidhya-venkadesh) and several colleagues built an AI tool for predicting the malignancy risk of lung nodules from chest CT scans. The AI tool uses deep learning algorithms based on 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  

The deep learning (DL) algorithm was developed on 16,077 nodules (1,249 cancers) from the National Lung Screening Trial. The algorithm was externally validated on 883 nodules (65 cancers) from the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial.
