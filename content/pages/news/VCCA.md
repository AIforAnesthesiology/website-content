It is our pleasure to announce this Save the date and call for abstracts for the first [Virtual Conference on Computational Audiology](https://computationalaudiology.com/event/virtual-conference-on-computational-audiology/) (VCCA) to be held on June 19, 2020!

In these times of social distancing, we intend to use the opportunities modern communication technology offers to bring researchers from all over the world together in a virtual conference setting. What better topic than the combination of audiology — the primary sense humans use for communication — and AI/computation — an advanced means by which we try to model and make sense of the world?

We have subdivided this broad topic into:
 - Computational models 
 - Machine learning for audiology 
 - AI for auditory implants 
 - e-Audiology (connected hearing health care) 
 - AI & Music (for hearing impaired people) 
 
Our central mission is to improve (access to) hearing healthcare for more than 450 million hearing impaired people worldwide. The target audience for this conference is young researchers that wish to present their work and ideas. We offer a podium to receive feedback from peers and to get mentored by senior researchers. 

The choice for a virtual conference means:
 - There will be no participation fee 
 - We can more easily reach out to research groups in AI and Audiology worldwide. 
 
There is a **young scientist award** for the best contribution to encourage input from young scientists.

**Format**  
All presentations and discussions will be recorded and together with the submitted abstracts made freely accessible via [our website](computationalaudiology.com). We would like to take advantage of the virtual aspects of this conference by creating sessions that consist of a mixture of different talk and discussion formats and distribute time slots over a 24 hour period. We provide the opportunity for researchers and research groups to submit one-minute videos explaining their work, which will be placed on the conference website. We also offer the opportunity to submit links to research group websites and announcements of webinars to be placed on the conference website. Last but not least, we will encourage social interaction by providing virtual “coffee breaks” and other social activities.

**Abstract submission**  
Abstracts of 300+/- words in length will be accepted online and must include Background, Methods, Results, and Conclusions (click this [link](https://computationalaudiology.com/ai-speech-recognition-apps-for-hearing-impaired-and-deaf/), for an example).
Submissions must include an e-mail address for all co-presenters/co-authors, and we strongly recommend the inclusion of a 2-minute [ignite style](http://www.ignitetalks.io/) video ([here on this page is a 2-minute example](https://computationalaudiology.com/vcca2020-program/) by Prof Barbour).
The link to the portal to submit your abstract online will be available at [https://computationalaudiology.com/vcca2020-call-for-abstracts/](https://computationalaudiology.com/vcca2020-call-for-abstracts/) on May 15, 2020.

The deadline for Abstract submission is **May 31** (we’ll try to upload abstract starting May 15).  
Notification of abstract acceptance will be **June 5**.
