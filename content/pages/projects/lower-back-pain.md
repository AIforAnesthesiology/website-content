description: The aim of this project is to develop AI-based MRI analysis software to help provide treatment decision support in patients with chronic degenerative low back pain.

## Project Description

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a highly prevalent disease with poorly understood aetiology. The affected population is heterogeneous and the condition multifactorial. This makes it challenging to determine the right treatment. In this project, we are developing a decision support tool to help patients and physicians choose a treatment that is likely to be successful. This decision support tool is based on automatic image analysis methods that assess degenerative spinal and muscular changes on MRI scans. We make use of state-of-the-art technologies such as deep learning.

This project is a collaboration of the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, the department of Orthopedics and the Sint Maartenskliniek.
