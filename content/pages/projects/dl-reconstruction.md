In the DIRECT (Deep Image REConsTruction) project we develop deep learning-based image reconstruction methods for Cone Beam CT (CBCT) and MRI reconstruction.
Many applications in imaging and radiotherapy would benefit from real-time reconstruction methods, that is, from methods that can directly map the measured machine data to the reconstructed image.
Even more so, the downstream task if often something else: for instance in radiotherapy the primary goal of creating a medical image is not so much the image itself, but the location of the tumor and the organs.
