The VPH-PRISM (Virtual Physiological Human: Personalised Predictive Breast Cancer Therapy Through Integrated Tissue Micro-Structure Modeling) project aimed to increase our understanding of the presentation of breast cancer on different radiological modalities (ultrasound, mammography, MRI etc) by correlating these modalities to each other and to histopathology. The project was executed in an international consortium, in which Radboudumc acted as both a clinical and research site. Radboudumc research was performed within DIAG, both at the Radiology department and the Pathology department. The research that was performed within the Computational Pathology Group resulted in 5 publications in peer reviewed journals as well as numerous conference papers, and in the PhD thesis ‘Histopathological Diagnosis of Breast Cancer’ by Dr Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi. Technology was developed to automatically detect and characterize different types of breast lesions, as well as to normalize differences in stain appearance between different laboratories.
