description: Project aimed at development of deep learning algorithms for the extraction of predictive features for immunotherapy treatment response in lung cancer patients.


## Background

Immunotherapy is a Nobel Prize winning approach to treat cancer patients, which has given spectacular responses in some previously untreatable cancer patients. However, many patients do not respond to immunotherapy and are only exposed to the toxicity of the drugs. Additionally, the cost of immunotherapy treatment is very high (~100kEuro per patient), which puts a dramatic financial burden on the healthcare system.
In this context, there is an urgent need for identifying responders and non-reponders at an early stage, to guarantee an efficient and personalized cancer treatment with immunotherapy.
In this project, Artificial Intelligence models will be used to challenge one of deadliest of the diseases: lung cancer.
AI has the potential to extract and discover features in histopathology images that correlate with treatment response.
Therefore, AI models will be developed to predict immunotherapy treatment response of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients.

**Research question:**
Is it possible to predict immunotherapy treatment response in NSCLC patients via histopathology image analysis?

## Tasks

AI will be leveraged to build machines for automatic assessment of biomarkers based on the analysis of digitalized histopathology images. Computational Pathology models will be developed for the characterization of the immune reaction of the organism in the presence of lung cancer, by extracting biomarkers based on assessment of cytotoxic T-cells (CD8), immune checkpoints (PD-L1), Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs), tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), among others, guided by the characterization of tissue morphology and composition of histopathology whole-slide images using deep learning methods. 
The goal is to develop a framework based on the synergy of digital pathology and AI for accurate classification of the tumor immune microenvironment of NSCLC to allow personalization of immunotherapy.

We will address one or more of the following tasks:

* Detection of PD-L1 positive cells with deep learning models for object detection and segmentation

We will develop a demonstrator that allows to run the built AI model/pipeline on new whole-slide images.
