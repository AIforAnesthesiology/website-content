description: A large number of AI products are now on the market. How should AI be implemented in radiology practice? 
bibkeys: 

Over one hundred CE certified products based on artificial intelligence for radiology are now for sale. This research project focuses on the questions how radiology departments can obtain an overview of the available products, how to best evaluate these products in terms of different aspects, from technical performance to cost-effectiveness and societal benefit, and how to implement AI in the radiology practice.

We have made a website available that lists all products: [AI for Radiology](https://grand-challenge.org/aiforradiology/)
