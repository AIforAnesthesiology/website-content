description: The IMAGINE study aims to find image features on mammograms that can distinguish aggressive breast tumours from those that would never threaten a woman’s life.

The IMAGINE study aims to find novel and confirm established image features on mammograms in the breast cancer screening programme that can distinguish aggressive breast tumours from those that would never threaten a woman’s life. To identify these features, computer algorithms will be used that allow for in-depth image analysis. In the IMAGINE project, these image features will be combined with pathological and clinical information to investigate whether they have a potential to distinguish between biological subtypes of breast cancer and predict the risk of breast cancer recurrence. This may improve screening practice by detecting aggressive lesions that need treatment in an early stage and preventing overtreatment of harmless disease.  In practice, identification of these image features could assist the screening radiologist in deciding when referral to a hospital is necessary or when monitoring is justified. The IMAGINE study is a multidisciplinary collaboration between experts from Radboudumc, the Netherlands Cancer Institute, UMC Utrecht and the Dutch Expert Centre for Screening.
