description: Research towards real-time AI driven modeling of MRI for image guided interventions.
bibkeys:

# Background

MRI allows patient-specific guidance during surgery.
Interpreting MRI imaging during surgery is however very challenging and time-consuming.
Technology for real-time accurate modeling is not available.
Artificial Intelligence, and more specifically Deep Learning, has shown promising results on segmentation of medical images, mainly for diagnostic use.
For interventional purposes, speed and accuracy are still major challenges.

# Aim
This project aims to research deep learning that will demonstrably help clinicians to provide real-time modeling of MRI during an intervention.
State-of-the-art deep learning models will be continuously evaluated and implemented in a clinical prototype for validation and feedback.
