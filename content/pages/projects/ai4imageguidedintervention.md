# Background

One million men receive a prostate cancer diagnosis, and three hundred thousand die from prostate cancer each year worldwide.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) represents a major breakthrough by accurately detecting clinically significant prostate cancers at an early, potentially more curable stage.
The same MRI can also be used for better treatment targeting and for avoiding unnecessary systematic biopsies.
MRI allows patient-specific guidance during surgery.
Interpreting MRI imaging during surgery is however very challenging and time-consuming.
Technology for real-time accurate modeling is not available.
Artificial Intelligence, and more specifically Deep Learning, has shown promising results on segmentation of medical images, mainly for diagnostic use.
For interventional purposes, speed and accuracy are still major challenges.

# Aim
This project aims to research deep learning that will demonstrably help clinicians to provide real-time modeling of MRI during an intervention.
State-of-the-art deep learning models will be continuously evaluated and implemented in a clinical prototype for validation and feedback.

# Funding
