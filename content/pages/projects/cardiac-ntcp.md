description: The goal of this project is to develop a cardiac toxicity model to optimize the radiotherapy treatment of lung cancer.

Dose to normal tissue in radiotherapy is unavoidable and can have significant impact on short-term and long-term survival after treatment. Consequently, normal tissue toxicity should be considered in every radiation treatment plan.
Cardiac toxicity in NSC lung cancer patients has been shown to have significant impact on overall survival and lead to cardiac events, namely myocarditis, after treatment. The true nature of this relationship is, however, poorly understood. Most studies on cardiac toxicity after radiotherapy have been small and cannot be generalized to clinical setting. Further dosimetric relationships with cardiac substructures have also not been studied. The major obstacles to such studies are the time and labor expensive manual delineations of the heart and its substructures.
We attempt to develop methods for automatic segmentation of the heart and its substructures and, subsequently, a cardiac toxicity model to help radiation oncologists choose appropriate treatment plans for each patient.
