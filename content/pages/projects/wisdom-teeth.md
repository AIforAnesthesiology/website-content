## Project Description

Unnecessary removal of wisdom teeth is an enormous health and economic problem worldwide. For example, costs associated with wisdom teeth removal exceed $3 billion in the USA every year. Moreover, wisdom teeth surgery causes approximately 11 million patient days of "standard discomfort or disability" in the States. Surprisingly, research studies have shown that more than half of these extractions are unnecessary. Nowadays, the decision flowchart for wisdom tooth removal is based on the experience of the surgeon as well as on considerations of a wide range of risk versus benefit factors, including the anatomy-, general health-, age-, dental status, drug history, other specific patient-, surgeon- and financial related factors. Taking the numerous interactions between all those factors into account, it is very challenging to make the correct decision during an average
presurgical consultation.

The goal of this project is to create an AI-driven decision flowchart (AIFC). In a first step, the AIFC will generate a categorial output based upon a 2D panoramic radiograph (OPG) and clinical signs, resulting in
1) advice to remove a wisdom tooth; 2) advice to not remove a wisdom tooth; or 3) recommend additional 3D imaging with a cone-beam CT (CBCT) scan. If the CBCT scan is available, the system will recommend whether or not to remove a wisdom tooth.

The system will be developed, validated, prospectively tested and implemented in close collaboration with AI experts of Radboud AI for Health and clinical experts at Radboudumc.
