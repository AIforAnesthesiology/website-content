## Background
Whole slide imaging technology allowed the digitization of conventional glass slides which led to several new opportunities in the field such as the integration of computational systems, most notably artificial intelligence. However, the digitization process also brought along new challenges for the automated analysis of tissue images. An important challenge arises from the presence of image artifacts, including, but not limited to
- air bubbles,
- out of focus regions,
- regions containing ink,
- tiling effect due to the stitching,
- folded or torn regions, or completely missed regions during scanning.
Accurate analysis of whole slide images depends on detection and elimination/correction of such artifacts.

## Tasks
- Collect and label artifacts in whole slide histopathology images
- Development of AI for segmentation of regions with artifacts
- Development of a demonstrator 
- Writing of manuscript in accordance with publication guidelines

## Innovation
The developed tool will be tested and subsequently implemented in the department of Pathology of the Radboudumc.
