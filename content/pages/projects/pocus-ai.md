Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is about using portable ultrasound devices, often with a phone or table for viewing the data, so that examinations can be made on-site, at the patient's bed-side, in an ambulance, or in the practice of a general practitioner. POCUS has the potential to save billions of euros and it can be used for many new applications. Cheap portable ultrasound devices are rapidly appearing on the market. But acquiring a proper ultrasound exam is not easy, and interpreting the images from the exam can also be complex. We aim to solve both aspects with real-time integrated deep learning.
