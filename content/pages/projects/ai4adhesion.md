description: The investigation of AI for painfull adhesion detection on MRI imaging
bibkeys: 

## Background

This project aims to improve outcomes in the 30.000 patients per year in the Netherlands that develop chronic pain after abdominal surgery often caused by adhesions. Medical consumption in these patients is high, 70% is under treatment of a gastroenterologist and one in three is opioid dependent. A recent, imaging technique (CineMRI) can detect and localize these adhesions, resulting in improved decision making and outcomes. CineMRI is not widely used for detection of adhesion in the abdomen, because radiological reading is time-consuming and expertise dependent. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help create tools that realize clinical implementation of CineMRI.

## Aim
Develop AI to improve reading adhesion MRI
