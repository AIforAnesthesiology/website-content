description: We investigate whether AI can detect painful abdominal adhesions on MRI imaging.
bibkeys: 

## Background

This project aims to improve outcomes in the 30,000 patients per year in the Netherlands that develop chronic pain after abdominal surgery. This pain is often caused by adhesions, tough bands of tissue that form between structures ands organs in the abdomen. Medical consumption in these patients is high, 70% is under treatment of a gastroenterologist and one in three is opioid dependent. A recently developed imaging technique, CineMRI, can detect and localize these adhesions, and this can be used to make treatment decisions. CineMRI is not widely used yet, because radiological reading is time-consuming and expertise dependent. In this research, we aim to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to create tools that realize clinical implementation of CineMRI.

## Aim
Develop AI to improve reading adhesion CineMRI sequences.
