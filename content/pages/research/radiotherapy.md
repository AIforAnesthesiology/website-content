Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Radiation therapy, or radiotherapy for short, plays a pivotal role in the treatment of many cancers, where approximately 50% of cancer patients can benefit from RT in the management of their disease. During radiotherapy ionizing radiation, generally produced by a linear accelerator (linac) is delivered with the intent of killing malignant cells.

In our research line on radiotherapy AI we focus on improving the efficacy of radiotherapy, by researching novel AI-based technologies to modulate therapy in time and space (spatiotemporal). When done in the context of the shape and temporal variation of the radio-sensitivity of the tumor, novel treatment paradigms can be developed.

At the Radboud University Medical Center we mainly focus on the applications for MRI-guided radiotherapy where we aim to develop technology to allow for realtime adaptation of treatment, and classical CBCT-guided radiotherapy where many questions relating to image quality and day-by-day replanning are yet to be answered.
