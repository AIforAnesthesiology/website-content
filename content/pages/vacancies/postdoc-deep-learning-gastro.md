description: Are you a creative researcher with a PhD degree in medical image analysis, computer vision, machine learning or similar? Do you want to contribute to the implementation of a algorithm-supported workflow for digital gastrointestinal pathology, which will increase the time of pathologists for complex diagnostics and reduce the wait time for patients? Then we are looking for you!

## Background

Diagnostic pathology involves microscopic evaluation of human tissues. Increasingly, microscopic images are digitized to support the diagnostic workflow. This rapidly growing field of ‘digital pathology’ also yields ample opportunities for development of CAD algorithms. State-of-the-art deep learning methods have recently been proven capable of supporting the diagnostic work of pathologists. We have now reached the point where such algorithms can be implemented in a routine clinical setting. For this project the Computational pathology group and the Gastrointestinal pathology research group of Radboudumc are seeking a postdoctoral researcher.

## Profile

* You should be a creative and enthusiastic researcher with a PhD degree in a relevant field, such as medical image analysis, computer vision, or machine learning.
* You should have a clear interest to develop image analysis algorithms and an affinity with medical topics.
* Good communication skills
* Expertise in software development, preferably in Python, are essential.


## Organisation

The Computational Pathology Group (CPG) is a research group of the department of Pathology of the Radboud University Medical Center.  We are part of the interdepartmental Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (DIAG). We develop, validate and deploy novel medical image analysis methods, usually based on machine learning technology and focusing on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Application areas include diagnostics and prognostics of breast, prostate and colon cancer. Our group is among the international front runners in the field, witnessed for instance by the highly successful CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 grand challenges which we organized. We closely collaborate with clinicians and industry.

The Radboudumc Gastrointestinal pathology research group is a translational research  group of the Department of Pathology, well embedded in the Radboudumc Research Theme Tumors of the Digestive Tract. We have a clear focus on a number of gastrointestinal cancers (colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer), both in the sporadic and hereditary setting. The influence of microbiome on cancer development is one of our innovative research lines.

## Working at Radboudumc

Radboudumc strives to be a leading developer of sustainable, innovative and affordable healthcare to improve the health and wellbeing of people and society in the Netherlands and beyond.
