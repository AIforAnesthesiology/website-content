description: We are looking for a PhD candidate to develop a real-time warning system for infection risk of central venous catheters for patients in the intensive care unit.

## Project Description

Central Venous Catheters (CVCs) are indispensable in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) for administration of high risk medication and parenteral nutrition. But the use of these catheters can lead to deadly ifections in the bloodstream. Such infections constitute a high burden by increased morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and increased health care expenditure. Even if optimal precautions (such as sterile CVC insertion, daily control of the CVC insertion site) are taken, these infections are still common, with an incidence of 1,1 per 1000 catheter days in the Netherlands. Different risk factors for development of catherters infections have been established, however it is not clearly understood which other factors may play a role. While there is debate about the most appropriate definition of a CVC infection, a straightforward registry with clear diagnostic criteria has been established in the Netherlands since 2010. Early prediction of ICU patients developing CVC infections could help healthcare professionals to take early precautionary measures such as removing the CVC before bloodstream infection occurs. It could also help to leave a CVC inserted if a low probability of CVC infection is found. It is for this purpose that we wish to develop and implement an algorithm predicting CVC infection risk in ICU patients in real-time.

## Requirements

We are looking for an ambitious, creative and enthusiastic computer scientist, biomedical engineer or data scientist. You should have a MSc degree in a relevant field, skills in developing artifical intelligence systems and text analysis. Good communication skills and programming experience, preferably in Python/C++, are essential. 

## Terms of employment

You will be appointed as a PhD student for four years with the standard salary and secondary conditions for PhD students in the Netherlands. Your performance will be evaluated after 1 year. The research should result in a PhD thesis and a real-time risk infection prediction system that will be implemented in clinical care at Radboudumc.

## Application

You can already apply directly by e-mail to [Dr. Tim Frenzel](mailto:Tim.Frenzel@radboudumc.nl). In your application include a motivation letter, your CV, list of grades and links to publications and your Master thesis or other work you have written in English.

All applications will be processed immediately upon receipt until the position has been filled.
