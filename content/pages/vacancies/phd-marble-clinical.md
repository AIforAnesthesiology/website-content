description: We are offering a PhD position for our MARBLE project. In this project we will develop and validate artificial intelligence techniques for detection and classification of lesions on digital breast tomosynthesis and breast MRI.

## Project Description
We are offering a fully funded PhD position on the evaluation of breast cancer screening with DBT and MRI and the impact of automated analysis on this process. Early detection of breast cancer enables timely treatment and is the key technique for the improvement of breast cancer specific survival. In a large retrospective database you will evaluate the frequency of non-detection of breast cancers, and the potential impact of this on cancer stage and outcome. You will work in close cooperation with a technical PhD student, who will develop automated tools for image evaluation (mainly MRI) and cancer detection. A large part of the research will consist of the clinical evaluation of the automated tools developed in house and by our industrial partner ScreenPoint Medical (focussing on DBT), with the aim of enhancing early detection and improving lesion classification. You will evaluate how these tools can best be used in clinical practice and to what extent they improve the performance of radiologists with different level of experience. In addition you will investigate potential risk predictors in the images to improve stratification of the screening population.

## Requirements
For this project the department of Radiology of the Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen (The Netherlands), is seeking an enthusiastic PhD student with a clear interest in the potential that AI techniques may have in the field of radiology. This is an excellent opportunity to assess and implement cutting-edge technology in order to have an impact on breast cancer research and personalized cancer treatment.
You should be a creative and enthusiastic researcher with a MSc in a relevant field, such as medicine, technical medicine, medical image analysis, medical biology, clinical epidemiology, or similar. Good communication skills are essential.

**Specific requirements**
Interest in medical imaging, with a particular focus on oncologic (breast) imaging and artificial intelligence. Interest in and preferably experience with scientific research. Independent work attitude. Basic skills in statistics (SPSS/R). Fluent in both Dutch (or willing to learn) and English.

##Terms of employment
The project will appoint a PhD candidate for 3 years in total. Your performance will be evaluated after 1 year. If the evaluation is positive, the contract will be extended by another 2 years.
The gross monthly salary, depending on education will be scale 10A (max. € 3.103) or scale 10 (max. € 4.481) based on a full-time working week (excl. vacation bonus and 8,3% end of year payments). 
Upon commencement of employment we require a certificate of conduct (Verklaring Omtrent het Gedrag, VOG) and there will be, depending on the type of job, a screening based on the provided cv. Radboud university medical center’s HR Department will apply for this certificate on your behalf.
