description: We are looking for a PhD candidate to build a system that can automatically create annotated radiology reports that a patient can understand.

## Project Description

Can we use multi-modal analysis of medical health records to inter-link the textual and image information and present the data in an intuitively clear manner?

Today, patients access their medical information using the mijnRadboud portal. Medical records are however not written with the patient in mind - the vocabulary gap between language that the patient would understand and the actual contents of their electronic health records is huge. Online health records will also include medical images, where even experts with extensive medical training rely on the support of radiologists to interpret that information. 

The proposed project explores (semi-)automatic methods to transform the electronic health records from mijnRadboud into an interactive online version that is easily explored and understood by the patient. To reduce the vocabulary gap, we will transform the textual information in the health record and/or link it to medical knowledge graphs. The scientific question is whether textual and image information reinforce each other to improve effectiveness of these methods. A specific problem to overcome is limited availability of resources for processing Dutch medical health records. Developing word embeddings, entity tagging and knowledge graph extraction from Dutch medical records will have sustainable impact on health innovation at RadboudUMC.

## Requirements

We are looking for an ambitious, creative and enthusiastic computer scientist, biomedical engineer or data scientist. You should have a MSc degree in a relevant field, skills in developing artifical intelligence systems and text analysis. Good communication skills and programming experience, preferably in Python/C++, are essential. 
## Terms of employment

You will be appointed as a PhD student for four years with the standard salary and secondary conditions for PhD students in the Netherlands. Your performance will be evaluated after 1 year. The research should result in a PhD thesis and a system that will be implemented within mijnRadboud portal.

## Application

You can already apply directly by e-mail to [Prof.dr. Arjen de Vries](mailto:A.deVries@cs.ru.nl). In your application include a motivation letter, your CV, list of grades and links to publications and your Master thesis or other work you have written in English.

All applications will be processed immediately upon receipt until the position has been filled.
