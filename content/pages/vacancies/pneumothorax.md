description: Develop a system to detect pneumothorax in frontal chest radiographs.


## Background
Pneumothorax is a medical condition, commonly referred to as a collapsed lung. It is a painful and potentially deadly condition that requires immediate attention.  Pneumothorax may be caused by an underlying lung disease, a blunt chest injury or other/unknown reasons. It is generally diagnosed by radiologists through examining chest radiographs (chest x-rays) and can be difficult to confirm - can you see the pneumothorax in the image shown here?! For further information see [the radiopedia definition](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pneumothorax). 

Recently, the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) organized [a kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/overview) to tackle the detection and segmentation of this condition on chest x-ray images.  At DIAGNijmegen, we are interested in creating an open-source algorithm that uses this dataset (initially) to detect pneumothorax.

## Research question and tasks
Detection and segmentation of pneumothorax in chest x-rays. 

### Tasks
* Research previous work on segmentation of 2D medical images
* Research previous work on pneumothorax detection
* Develop a deep learning method that tackles the task
* Issue late submissions in [the leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/) and compare model performance with winning submissions
* Test your model on data from different institutions
* Publish your algorithm under an open source license

<!-- ## Innovation --> 

## Requirements

- Students in the final year of a study in computer science, artificial intelligence, physics, or a related area.
- Knowledge of and experience with deep learning image analysis. You should be able to implement systems described in [this book](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python). 

## Information

- Project duration: 6 months
- Location: Radboud University Medical Center
