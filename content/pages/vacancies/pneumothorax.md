description: Develop a system to detect pneumothorax in frontal chest radiographs.


## Background
Pneumothorax is the medical name of a collapsed lung. It is a painful and deadly condition that requires immediate attention. It may be caused by an underlying lung disease or a blunt chest injury or some unknown reasons. Generally, pneumothorax is diagnosed by radiologists through examining chest radiographs (chest x-rays) and can be difficult to confirm (see [the radiopedia definition](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pneumothorax) for more information). 

Recently, the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIMM) organized [a kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/overview) that tackles the detection and segmentation of this disease. In DIAGNijmegen, we are interested in creating an open-source algorithm that uses this dataset to detect pneumothorax.

## Research question and tasks
Detection and segmentation of pneumothorax in chest x-rays. 

### Tasks
* Research previous work on segmentation of 2D images
* Research previous work on pneumothorax detection
* Develop a deep learning method that tackles the task
* Issue late submissions in [the leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/) and compare model performance with winning submissions
* Test your model on data from different institutions
* Publish your algorithm under an open source license

<!-- ## Innovation --> 

## Requirements

- Students at the final year of a study in computer science, artificial intelligence, physics, or a related area.
- Knowledge on and experience with deep learning image analysis. You should be able to implement systems described in [this book](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python). 

## Information

- Project duration: 6 months
- Location: Radboud University Medical Center
