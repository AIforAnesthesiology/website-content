description: Aim of the proposed project is to develop deep learning algorithms for the extraction of features from scanned H&E and immunohistochemically stained tissue sections from lung cancer that carry predictive value in the context of immunotherapy treatment response.


## Background

Immunotherapy has shown unprecedent results in cancer treatment and fostered a strong focus on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) both in research and in the clinic. Initially adopted in metastatic setting, soon ICI will be available in an adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting to treat early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Given the high costs of treatment and associated adverse events, there is an unmet need for predictive and prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC patients undergoing ICI.

**Research question:**
Is it possible to predict immunotherapy treatment response in NSCLC patients via histopathology image analysis?

## Tasks

To develop a framework based on the synergy of digital pathology and AI for accurate classification of the tumor immune microenvironment of non-small cell lung cancer to allow personalization of (neo-adjuvant) immunotherapy. Multiple student projects are available in the context of this research. Contact the supervisor of this project for more information about availability of projects.

## Requirements

- Students with a major in computer science, biomedical engineering, artificial intelligence, physics, or a related area in the final stage of master level studies are invited to apply.

- Interest in image analysis and machine learning

- Affinity with programming in Python is required.

## Information

- Project duration: 3-9 months

- Location: Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre
