description: The goal of this project is to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) to track tumor targets and automatically steer MRI acquisitions to optimally visualize these targets in real-time MRI conditions. 


## Background

MRI is well-suited for minimally invasive treatment of soft tissue. Examples are treatment of small cancers in the prostate or positive lymph nodes. Modern focal treatment procedures of prostate cancer rely on insertion of, for instance, a needle that subsequently needs to be guided towards the target volume. MRI enables intervention radiologists to non-invasively track the needle, whilst monitoring the target volume in order to guide the needle towards the target volume during surgery. 

Interpreting MRI imaging during surgery is however very challenging, partly due to its low image resolution to accommodate real-time acquisition. Furthermore, it is difficult to keep the needle and target volume in focus due to needle movement and internal deformations. Bringing the needle and target back in focus requires manual adjustment of MRI acquisition settings, which is error prone and time-consuming.

The goal of this project is to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) to track targets and automatically steer MRI acquisitions to optimally visualize these targets in real-time MRI conditions. 

## Tasks

- Develop an MRI simulation module to test and train AI that generates synthetic MRI images with moving targets with adjustable motion
- Develop an MRI tracking module that predicts the target location 
- Develop a demonstrator that compares conventional versus AI driven interventional MRI 

## Requirements

- Students at the final year of a study in computer science, artificial intelligence, physics, or a related area.

- Basic level of knowledge and experience in Deep Learning in Healthcare

## Information

- Project duration: 6-9 months

- Location: Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre
