description: The goal of this project is to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) to track tumor targets and automatically steer MRI acquisitions to optimally visualize these targets in real-time MRI conditions. 


## Background

MRI allows minimally invasive treatment of cancer and other diseases. MRI accurately reveals a tumor within an organ or at difficult to  reach locations. Using real-time MRI special needles are inserted such that the tip is within the tumor. Several types of treatment exist. One such treatment is to heat the tumor tip. Tissue surrounding the tip is exposed to the treatment and tissue cells in that region are killed and subsequently broken down by the body. The size of the region depends on the duration of the treatment. This type of treatment has several advantages. MRI guided interventions prevents having to surgically search for the tumor reducing disruption to anatomical structures. The real-time feedback on the effect of the intervention ensures good coverage of the tumor region. The minimally invasive procedure allows faster recovery of the patient.

The accuracy of interventional MRI is unfortunately limited by . Interventional MRI Interpreting real-time MRI imaging during the intervention is challenging. The chalpartly due to its low image resolution to accommodate real-time acquisition. Furthermore, it is difficult to keep the needle and target volume in focus due to needle movement and internal deformations. Bringing the needle and target back in focus requires manual adjustment of MRI acquisition settings, which is error prone and time-consuming.

The goal of this project is to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) to track targets and automatically steer MRI acquisitions to optimally visualize these targets in real-time MRI conditions. 

## Tasks
