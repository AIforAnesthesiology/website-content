Evgenia Martynova is a master’s student in [Data Science](https://www.ru.nl/english/education/masters/data-science/) at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/) Nijmegen. She obtained her first degree in Applied Mathematics and Software Engineering from [Voronezh State University](https://www.vsu.ru/english/) in Russia and worked as a Mobile Software Engineer for a few years. During her career, Evgenia was involved in diverse projects from small local ones to large distributed international projects. While working as a Software Engineer, she kept an interest in becoming a researcher and eventually decided to start master’s studies at Radboud to achieve this aspiration.

For her master thesis, she joined the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl), where she will develop an automated system for adhesion detection on cine-MRI. The final deliverable of the project will be a publicly available algorithm on the platform [Grand Challenge](https://grand-challenge.org/algorithms/). She is supervised by [member/bram-de-wilde], [member/henkjan-huisman] and [Twan van Laarhoven](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/laarhoven-t-van/).
