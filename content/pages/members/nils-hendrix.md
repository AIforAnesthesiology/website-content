Nils Hendrix completed the [Research Master’s track in Communication and Information Sciences](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/onderwijs/masteropleidingen/research-master-linguistics-and-communication) at [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/) in December 2018 (cum laude). In collaboration with [Philips Research Eindhoven](https://www.philips.com/a-w/research/locations/eindhoven.html), he did his Master thesis project on “Unsupervised Generative Modelling for Outlier Detection in Digital Pathology Images”. As of January 2019, he has a PhD position on “Deep Learning for Automatic Detection of Bone Fractures” under supervision of [Matthieu Rutten](
https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/matthieu-rutten/), [Sharon Ong](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/medewerkers/l-l-ong), [Eric Postma](https://ericpostma.nl/), and [Bram van Ginneken](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/bram-van-ginneken/). The overarching aim of the PhD project is to automatically detect fractures in the scaphoid (a small bone in the wrist) and to determine whenever additional imaging is required, as this type of fracture is often under diagnosed.
