Anton Schreuder is a PhD student at the Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, working as part of the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group. His bachelor consisted of the pre-medical track at the University College Roosevelt, Middelburg (2009 to 2012), directly followed by studying at the Leiden university medical center, Leiden, where he obtained his medical degree in 2016. Anton is doing research on the use of CT scans for the screening of lung cancer, more specifically the epidemiological aspect of determining participation eligibility which would lead to a more effective screening.
