Anton Schreuder started as a PhD student at the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group (Radboudumc, Nijmegen) in 2016 right after obtaining his medical degree Leiden University Medical Center. His research is primarily based on risk prediction modelling in the field of lung cancer CT screening. The broad goal of his research is to use information from CT scans to determine who should (continue to) participate in the screening programs as well as how often they should be screened. This project is being carried out under the supervision of Cornelia Schaefer-Prokop (primary promoter), Bram van Ginneken (secondary promoter), Colin Jacobs (co-promoter), and Mathias Prokop (supervisor) and was funded by the Dutch Cancer Society and Bram van Ginneken's VICI grant.
