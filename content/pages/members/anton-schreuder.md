Anton Schreuder started as a PhD student in the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/) of the [Department of Radiology and Nuclear Imaging](https://www.radboudumc.nl/afdelingen/radiologie-en-nucleaire-geneeskunde) of the [Radboudumc (Nijmegen)](https://www.radboudumc.nl/research) in 2016 right after obtaining his medical degree [Leiden University Medical Center](https://www.lumc.nl/onderwijs/geneeskunde/). His research is primarily based on risk prediction modelling in the field of lung cancer CT screening. The broad goal of his research is to use information from CT scans to determine who should (continue to) participate in the screening programs as well as how often they should be screened ([project/lung-cancer-screening] project). Anton's supervision team consists of [member/cornelia-schaefer-prokop] (primary promoter), [member/bram-van-ginneken] (secondary promoter), [member/colin-jacobs (co-promoter), and [member/mathias-prokop] (supervisor) and was funded by the [Dutch Cancer Society](https://www.kwf.nl/onderzoek?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3diSspTF6wIVhbp3Ch13iAmrEAAYASACEgLitPD_BwE) and [Bram van Ginneken's VICI grant](https://www.ru.nl/@762601/vici-toekenningen/#h36c30be4-a911-4d4a-94e4-ed1d7afb49ef).
