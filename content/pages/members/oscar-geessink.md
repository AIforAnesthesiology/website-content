He studied Technical Medicine (Clinical Technology) with a specialization in Robotics & Imaging at the University of Twente in Enschede. After his graduation in 2013, he worked as a researcher at the <a href="https://www.labpon.nl/">Laboratory for Pathology East Netherlands</a> (LabPON) in Hengelo where he investigated automatic quantification of tumor and stroma tissue in rectal cancer whole-slide images. In July 2015, he joined the Computational Pathology Group and started on the Alpe dâ€™HuZes/KWF funded project "Automatic assessment of immune cell infiltrate for reliable and affordable cancer prognostication" under the supervision of Jeroen van der Laak, Francesco Ciompi and Iris Nagtegaal.
