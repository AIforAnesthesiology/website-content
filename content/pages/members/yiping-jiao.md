Yiping Jiao received his Masterâ€™s degree in Control Science and Engineering from Southeast University, China, and is currently working on deep learning-based digital pathology image analysis as a Ph.D. student. His main interests are in deep learning-based classification and segmentation, and on how to gain robustness to staining and deformation variabilities. Additionally he is looking at semi-supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as multi-instance and multi-task learning. Yiping is currently visiting the Computational Pathology group for one year, under supervision of Francesco Ciompi and Jeroen van der Laak.
