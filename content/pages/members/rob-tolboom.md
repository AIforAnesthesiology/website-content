After graduation from secondary education (Baarnsch Lyceum) in 2005, he moved to Utrecht to study Medicine at Utrecht University. During the latter years of his study, his interest in research was sparked and he started contributing to a research project at the department of cardiology as research-assistant. He finished his master’s degree with a senior internship at the department of surgery at the Sint Antonius Hospital in Nijmegen, followed by a senior internship at the department of pediatric anesthesiology at the Wilhelmina Childrens’ hospital in Utrecht. 

Following his graduation in 2012, Rob started working at the Meander Medical Center in Amersfoort as a surgical resident (not in training). Here he met prof. Broeders and dr. Draaisma with whom he initiated several research projects which eventually culminated to his thesis on High-tech Hiatal Hernia surgery. 

After working at several other hospitals in the fields of general surgery and intensive care medicine, he decided to enter the anesthesiology residency program at Radboud University Medical Center under supervision of dr. C. Keijzer-Broeders. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to him following a course on AI for Health at the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science in Den Bosch. 

His current research focusses primarily on AI implementations in anesthesiologic care.
