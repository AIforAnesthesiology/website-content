Ward Hendrix finished the Master’s programme Integrated Product Design at Delft University of Technology in April 2019 (cum laude). The topic of his MSc thesis was “Harthulp: a smart question-and-answer platform for cardiac patients”. He currently works as a PhD-student on the project “early lung cancer detection with CT” under supervision of Bram van Ginneken, Colin Jacobs and Matthieu Rutten. The main goal of the PhD project is to develop automated software to identify and measure pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Another important part of the project is to implement and validate the software in Radboudumc and Jeroen Bosch Hospital.
