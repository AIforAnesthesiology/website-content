Niels van den Hork is a master's student in Data Science at the Radboud University Nijmegen. Here he also received his bachelor's degree in computing science. For his master thesis he joined the Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, where he will design a model for the differentiation of STIC lesions from normal fallopian tube epithelium. The output of this research will be an algorithm that can identify aberrant tubal epithelium within BRCA1/2 carries with a high sensitivity.
