    <h1> AI for Health course </h1>
    Radboud AI for Health plans to run two courses every year for a group of around 25 professionals from Radboudumc interested to learn more about AI applications in healthcare. The course program will consist of lectures and practical exercises, and will conclude with a practical project around a Radboudumc case. 

    The course is a collaboration between Radboudumc and the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (<a href="https://www.jads.nl/">JADS</a>) in Den Bosch.
