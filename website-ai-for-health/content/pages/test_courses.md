## AI for Health course
Radboud AI for Health plans to run two courses every year for a group of around 25 professionals from Radboudumc interested to learn more about AI applications in healthcare. The course program will consist of lectures and practical exercises, and will conclude with a practical project around a Radboudumc case. 

The course is a collaboration between Radboudumc and the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science ([JADS](https://www.jads.nl/)) in Den Bosch. 

## What you need to know for the third edition of the course:
- The course will be held on 14 Fridays, with different topics per day, starting in September 2021.
- The course days consist of lectures in the morning and afternoon practicals with cases focused on Radboudumc practice.
- The program for the 14 Fridays will mostly be held at Radboudumc in Nijmegen and a few times at JADS in Den Bosch.
- In addition there will be 4 project days, also on Fridays, in the Radboudumc where you will work in a team on a Radboudumc project.
- We expect participants to spend on average 4 hours per week on homework and self study.
- There will be an online training environment with support documentation, discussion forum and blended learning.
- The course will end with a graduation ceremony where teams will present their project results and a certificate will be awarded.
