Artificial intelligence is intelligence that is not of biological origin, but demonstrated by artificial machines and algorithms. In practice it encompasses a large collection of methods that give rise to some form of intelligent behavior. The recent surge in interest in AI is mainly caused by the success that different self learning algorithms have shown on various tasks that human typically perform, such as recognizing objects. 

Machine learning is the collective name of these learning based methods and drives most of the AI applications in use today. A machine learning algorithms typically receives some data as input (for example an image), then performs some internal computations and provides on output (for example a class to which the image belongs). By getting feedback about whether the image was classifief correctly the algorithm will learn and become better at the task. Eventually an algorithm can become so good at a task that it even outperforms humans. 

Deep learning is a subset of these learning based algorithms that makes use of multiple 'layers' of computations, hence the adjective 'deep'. These deep learning algorithms are also called 'neural networks', referring to their similarity to how biological brains work. These algorithms are particularly successfull on highly structured data such as images, text, audio, etc.

During the course we will explain the similarities and differences between machine learning and deep learning and how to choose which one you need for your application. You will get an overview of the most common machine learning and deep learning methods that are being used and how to determine which method is best suited for a particular data set and a certain task. Furthermore you will get an understanding of the basic principles underlying these methods and learn how to actually train an algorithm during the practicals.
