## AI for Health course
Radboud AI for Health plans to run two courses every year for a group of around 25 professionals from Radboudumc interested to learn more about AI applications in healthcare. The course program will consist of lectures and practical exercises, and will conclude with a practical project around a Radboudumc case. 

The course is a collaboration between Radboudumc and the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science ([JADS](https://www.jads.nl/)) in Den Bosch. 

## What you need to know for the third edition of the course:
- The course will be held on 14 Fridays, with different topics per day, starting in September 2021.
- The course days consist of lectures in the morning and afternoon practicals with cases focused on Radboudumc practice.
- The program for the 14 Fridays will mostly be held at Radboudumc in Nijmegen and a few times at JADS in Den Bosch.
- In addition there will be 4 project days, also on Fridays, in the Radboudumc where you will work in a team on a Radboudumc project.
- We expect participants to spend on average 4 hours per week on homework and self study.
- There will be an online training environment with support documentation, discussion forum and blended learning.
- The course will end with a graduation ceremony where teams will present their project results and a certificate will be awarded.

An overview of the course schedule can be seen below.

## Second edition
The second edition of the AI for Health course started September 18, 2020. A group of 20 Radboudumc employees and 2 employees of the Jeroen Bosch hospital followed the course, consisting of 14 days of lectures and practical assignments at the Radboudumc and JADS. At the end of the course the participants formed five teams that spend 4 days to develop an AI solution to a challenging clinical problem. You can read about their final presentations [here](https://www.ai-for-health.nl/news/final_presentations_second_ai_for_health_course/).


## First edition
The first edition of the AI for Health course started November 2, 2019. A group of 25 Radboudumc employees followed the course, consisting of 11 days of lectures and practical assignments at JADS. The participants formed six teams that have developed an AI solution to a challenging clinical problem. You can read about their final presentations [here](https://www.ai-for-health.nl/news/final-presentation-first-ai-for-health-course/).

An introductory presentation by Egge van der Poel was given on September 16, 2019. The slides of this presentation can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nnYpNSdr10E3Zm7IiV78UFj239eIV4Yx).

## Testimonials
_“I was a participant of the first group that followed this course, therefore it felt sometimes a bit like trial and error. It's nice to see that the lessons we've learned have already been incorporated into the new course._

_Despite this, I learned a lot, both about the backgrounds of data science and AI as well as in applying them. I actually became even more curious about what can be achieved by applying data science and AI models to the gigantic mountain of data that the Radboudumc has.
The course was an alternation between theory and practice and covers a wide range of topics, including for example machine learning, data visualization, ultrasound images and genetic data._

_Do you want to acquire knowledge about the data science and AI, or do you already have experience with facets of data science and do you want to deepen, broaden or apply this knowledge within the Radboudumc? Then this course is highly recommended!“_ according to Pascal van Nispen, interface specialist, Department Information Management at the Radboudumc
