## AI for Health course
Radboud AI for Health plans to run two courses every year for a group of around 25 professionals from Radboudumc interested to learn more about AI applications in healthcare. The course program will consist of lectures and practical exercises, and will conclude with a practical project around a Radboudumc case. Details of the program will be set up in collaboration with the participants.

The course will be organized in a collaboration between Radboudumc, Radboud University and the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS) in Den Bosch. A presentation by Egge van der Poel was given during an information session on September 16, 2019. The slides of this presentation can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nnYpNSdr10E3Zm7IiV78UFj239eIV4Yx). 

The first edition of the AI for Health course started November 2, 2019. A group of 25 Radboudumc employees followed the course, conisting of 11 days of lectures and practical assignments at [JADS](https://www.jads.nl/). The participants formed six teams that are now developing an AI solution to a challenging clinical problem.
