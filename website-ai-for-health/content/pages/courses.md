description: AI courses for health(care) professionals with a background in Medicine, Biomedical Sciences or Technical Medicine. 

Radboud AI for Health plans to run two courses every year for a group of around 25 professionals from Radboudumc interested to learn more about AI applications in healthcare. The course program will consist of lectures and practical exercises, and will conclude with a practical project around a Radboudumc case. Details of the program will be set up in collaboration with the participants. 

On the 16th of September there will be a meeting at 15:00h in the [Tuinzaal](https://www.radboudumc.nl/onderwijs/scholingen/peri-operatieve-zorg/locatie) to discuss the AI for Health course content. Via [this link](https://radboudumc-web.ungerboeck.com/reg/reg_p1_form.aspx?oc=10&ct=COURREGADD1&eventid=10408) you can register to attend both the course information meeting and the [opening event of the two ICAI Labs in Nijmegen](https://www.ai-for-health.nl/news/icai_opening/).
