description: AI projects for Radboud University Bachelor and Master students.

We are continuously looking for interesting new projects. Following the weekly AI for Health [meeting](https://www.ai-for-health.nl/meeting/) there is a consultation hour in which new project proposals can be discussed. To propose a new project, please fill out this [form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NNoRgsveqYtj1YI8HyRf_DWOqcSkWfWG/view?usp=sharing). We ask you to send the completed form to [aiforhealth@radboudumc.nl](mailto:aiforhealth@radboudumc.nl) and to make an appointment to discuss the project during one of the consultation hours (every Thursday afternoon 16:00 - 17:00 PM).

MSc students are eligible to receive a monthly reimbursement of &euro;500,- for a period of six months. An overview of current project vacancies can be seen below.
