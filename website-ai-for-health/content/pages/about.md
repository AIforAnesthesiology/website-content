Opening of Thira Lab and Radboud AI for Health Lab
 
We proudly invite you to the opening event on Monday September 16 of two newly established AI initiatives at Radboud university medical center: Radboud AI for Health and Thira Lab. These are the first two Nijmegen-based 'labs' within the nationwide Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence (ICAI). 
 
Thira Lab
Thira Lab is a collaboration between Radboudumc and Thirona, a spin-out company from Radboudumc, and Delft Imaging Systems, a company developing healthcare solutions for the specific needs of vulnerable communities around the world. In Thira Lab, nine Ph.D. candidates and post-docs from Radboudumc work on deep learning image analysis of CT scans, radiographs and retinal images. 
 
Radboud AI for Health 
Radboud AI for Health is a new collaboration between Radboud University and Radboudumc, and is part of Radboud AI, a campus-wide initiative to improve collaboration and start new projects with AI researchers in Nijmegen. Radboud AI for Health has awarded 6 Ph.D. positions, aimed to bring a variety of AI solutions to the clinic. We hope that a second call for Ph.D. positions can be launched soon. Radboud AI for Health, located in the Radboudumc Innovation Space, will also house BSc and MSc students who perform AI research projects in collaboration with Radboudumc clinicians. Finally, the Lab offers courses to Radboudumc employees who want to learn more about the application of AI in healthcare.
 
Program
The opening event will take place in the Tuinzaal (route 706). We will start with a walk-in lunch from 12.30h. At 13.00h prof. Paul Smits, Chair of the Executive Board of Radboudumc, will open the event. There will be several short talks, demos, and pitches about ICAI, Radboud AI, Thira Lab, and Radboud AI for Health Lab. We will explain our goals, plans, and ambitions with these exciting new initiatives and are happy to discuss opportunities with the audience.
The meeting ends at 14.30h and there will be time until 15.00h for drinks and networking.
