description: The Radboud AI for Health Lab, why, what and how?

Radboud AI for Health is an [ICAI](https://icai.ai/) lab. It is a collaboration between [Radboud University]() and [Radboudumc]() aimed at developing innovations based on artificial intelligence that solve clinical problems. The innovations will be applied in Radboudumc and other healthcare institutes. We perform PhD research projects and BSc/MSc research projects. We also offer courses for Radboudumc personnel on the use of AI in healthcare.
