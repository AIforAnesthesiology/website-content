# Redirecting pages

We support meta-type redirects for pages. This can be useful if you want to forward visitors to another page. To redirect, add the `redirect` tag to a page:

```
title: Old page
redirect: https://www.computationalpathologygroup.eu/software/automated-gleason-grading/

Some content
```
