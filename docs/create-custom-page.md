Custom pages are 'stand alone' pages such as https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/doing-a-phd-at-diag/

Custom pages can be made by creating a .md file inside the website folder. For DIAG this is https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/website-content/tree/master/website-diag/content. Each page should have at least a `title` tag at the top of the md file.
