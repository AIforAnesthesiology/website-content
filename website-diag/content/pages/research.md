Imaging is a cornerstone of modern medicine. The amount of imaging that is performed is growing, the number of modalities is growing, and the resolution and dimensionality of the scans is increasing. Our research focuses on creating software to let computers help physicians in the image interpretation process. Our activities cover the whole spectrum from research, development, evaluation, to translation to the clinic. We therefore work closely with clinicians and have a disease oriented approach. We develop image processing and machine learning algorithms, but also carry out observer studies, and develop and support software that runs in a clinical environment.
