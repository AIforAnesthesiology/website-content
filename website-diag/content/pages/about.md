title: About DIAG

The Diagnostic Image Analysis Group was founded in January 2010. This page provides a brief history. 

## Mammography
When mammography screening for breast cancer started in The Netherlands in 1989, the national reference center was established in Nijmegen. [member/nico-karssemeijer], then a post-doc at Radboudumc, realized that computer analysis of mammograms was going to be a key area within medical image analysis, especially when [digital screening](/publications/nab90) would become a reality. He published his [first paper](/publications/kars92) on the automatic detection of abnormalities in mammograms in 1992.

Karssemeijer soon established one of the leading groups in the emerging field of computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD). He set up a long collaboration with the Bay Area tech company [R2 Technology](http://web.archive.org/web/19981111190238/http://www.r2tech.com/), which developed the first FDA approved CAD product for detecting breast cancer in mammograms. The [core technology](http://web.archive.org/web/19981111190238/http://www.r2tech.com/) for this product is based on Karssemeijer's method of [stellate distortion detection](/publications/kars96a). 

Mammography CAD remains an active research area within DIAG. Research has expanded into breast density estimation from mammograms, initially together with [Matakina Ltd](http://www.matakina.com/) (Wellington, New Zealand), a startup co-founded by Karssemeijer and now named Volpara, and the design of computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems for other modalities such as [tomosynthesis](/publications/schi13a), [3D ultrasound](/publications/tan12a) and [MRI](/publications/gube15b). 

## Prostate image analysis
[member/henkjan-huisman], who obtained his PhD in 1998 on [ultrasound analysis](/publications/huis98c) joined Nico Karssemeijer to expand the field of research to breast and prostate MRI. His first publication with [Jelle Barentsz](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/people/jelle-barentsz) on the topic appeared [in 1999](/publications/bare99). Radboudumc is a worldwide leading center for prostate cancer imaging, and DIAG therefore pioneered the development of [prostate CAD](/publications/litj14c) and decision support systems. 

In 2013, DIAG set up a quality controlled environment (MDD Annex II and ISO 13485) for developing medical device software and CE marked Huisman's ProCAD software. ProCAD was used on a daily basis in clinical practice in several hospitals in Europe and Australia. Huisman now also focuses on real-time AI support during interventions for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. 

## Chest radiography and CT
In 2010, [member/bram-van-ginneken] came from University Medical Center Utrecht and joined Nico Karssemeijer at Radboudumc. They adopted the name Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, DIAG for short. In 2011 and 2012, Nico Karssemeijer and Bram van Ginneken were appointed full professor at Radboud University. DIAG was initially a group of about 10 researchers, but the group grew quickly and the overall size increased by around 10 people every year. 

Van Ginneken had performed his PhD research on the [automatic detection of tuberculosis in chest radiographs](/publications/ginn01a) at the Image Sciences Institute in Utrecht, The Netherlands from 1997 to 2001. This work continues within DIAG to date, co-funded by the Dutch company [Delft Imaging](http://www.delft.care/) under the name [CAD4TB](https://www.delft.care/cad4tb/). In 2014, CAD4TB was CE marked by DIAG. The software that analyzes chest radiographs for signs of tuberculosis is now in active use in over 35 countries, mainly in African and Asia, and processes around 5000 chest radiographs per day.

In Utrecht, Van Ginneken started to work on the analysis of chest CT scans [in 2003](/publications/slui03), and together with [member/mathias-prokop], now head of the [Department of Imaging](http://www.radboudimaging.nl/index.php/Home) at Radboudumc, began to develop a wide range of techniques and algorithms for detecting and analyzing lung cancer, COPD, and other lung diseases. [member/eva-van-rikxoort] was one of the PhD students who [graduated](/publications/rikx09d) in the Utrecht chest CT group of Van Ginneken and Prokop, and after a postdoc at UCLA she joined DIAG in 2011. In the same year, the chest radiologist [member/cornelia-schaefer-prokop] joined DIAG making chest CT a research focus.

[member/colin-jacobs] did his PhD on early detection of lung cancer in CT and after his [graduation](/publications/jaco15b) he continued to lead the chest CT lung cancer research. Jacobs was lead developer of CIRRUS Lung Screening, software for reading low dose lung cancer screening CT scans with integrated tools for nodule detection, matching, segmentation and characterization. This was commercialized in collaboration with [MeVis Medical Solutions](http://www.mevis.de/) as [Veolity](https://www.veolity.com/), and under different brandings this software is market leader for lung cancer screening reading solutions.

## Retinal image analysis
Another activity that Bram van Ginneken started in Utrecht and continued in Nijmegen was analysis of retinal images. [member/clarisa-sanchez] joined Bram van Ginneken in Utrecht as a postdoc and went with him to Nijmegen where she is now a faculty member, leading the research on [image analysis of ophthalmological images](https://www.a-eyeresearch.nl/). DIAG is closely collaborating with Radboudumc's Department of Ophthalmology in this area and a first joint paper was published [in 2013](/publications/grin13).

## Computational Pathology
Radiologists used to look at images on a [lightbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbox). Today they obviously use computer screens; only when you search on google for pictures of a radiologist, you'll still see films and lightboxes. Pathologists, on the other hand, still use their microscopes to look at glass slides. But google for pictures of a pathologist and you start to see computer screen with zoomed in pathology slides. The reason that pathology is two decades behind radiology in terms of digitization is that scanned tissue slides at the resolution needed by a pathologist are very large. But nowadays, progress in computer technology makes fully digital pathology departments economically feasible. DIAG realized that this transition has the same potential for computer-aided diagnosis as in radiology and started in 2013 with research project on computational pathology, led by [member/jeroen-van-der-laak] and later joined by [member/geert-litjens] and [member/francesco-ciompi].

### ScreenPoint and Thirona
In 2014, two spin-off companies were established by DIAG members. [member/nico-karssemeijer] founded [ScreenPoint](http://www.screenpoint-medical.com/), focusing on solutions for computerized interpretation of mammograms and digital breast tomosynthesis. [member/eva-van-rikxoort] and [member/bram-van-ginneken] started [Thirona](http://www.thirona.eu/), a company that provides tools and services for medical image analysis and imaging quantification. Several alumni of DIAG work in these new companies.

## Strategic collaboration with Fraunhofer MEVIS
Bremen-based [Fraunhofer MEVIS](http://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/en.html) and DIAG have been successfully collaborating as partners in research projects in the area of breast imaging since the mid-nineties, long before MEVIS became part of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. In 2010, this collaboration was deepened and DIAG and Fraunhofer MEVIS established a strategic partnership. There is a continuous exchange of softare, data, and personnel between the two groups. Van Ginneken holds a part-time position at Fraunhofer MEVIS and several Fraunhofer MEVIS researchers have perfoermed or are performing their PhD research at DIAG. [MeVisLab](http://www.mevislab.de/) has been adopted at DIAG as the software environment to build medical image analysis applications.

## An expanding set of topics
DIAG has also expanded its activities to neuro image analysis with [MRI](http://diagnijmegen.nl/index.php/White_Matter_Lesions) and [4D computed tomography](http://diagnijmegen.nl/index.php/4DCT), and has more recently started several projects in the area of

radiotherapy

In 2015, the group has grown to 8 faculty members, 5 post-docs, 4 scientific programmers, and 28 PhD students. DIAG is a very diverse and international group, our 45 researchers originally come from 12 different countries.

## grand-challenge
[DIAGTechnologies](http://www.diagtechnologies.com/) was established in 2012 as a division of DIAG with the purpose of providing an organization that can develop, maintain, and distribute software for analysis of medical images in a quality controlled certified environment. As of 2013, DIAGTechnologies is fully compliant with MDD Annex II and ISO 13485. The first product released by DIAGTechnologies is ProCAD, an optimized reading environment for multi-parametric prostate MRI studies. ProCAD is CE marked for distribution within Europe since May 2013 and TGA marked for distribution in Australia since November 2013. In March 2014, the second product of DIAGTechnologies, CAD4TB, was CE marked.

To achieve a consistent user interface for all our applications with the look and feel of a modern radiological workstation, we have built [CIRRUS](https://rse.diagnijmegen.nl/software/cirrus/). Most of the applications developed by DIAG researchers use CIRRUS.
