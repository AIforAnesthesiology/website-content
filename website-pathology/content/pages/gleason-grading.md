title: Evaluation of Automated Gleason Grading

# Evaluation of automated Gleason grading

We are working on algorithms to automatically assign Gleason grades to prostate biopsies. For our evaluation we are looking for pathologists that would like to contribute to this project. Each pathologists is asked to grade 100 prostate biopsies and to report the Gleason growth patterns and final Gleason Grade Group. The biopsies are available through an easy-to-use online viewer; no software is required to view the biopsies.
