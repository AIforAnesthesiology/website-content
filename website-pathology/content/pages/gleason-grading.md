We are working on algorithms to automatically assign Gleason grades to prostate biopsies using artificial intelligence. For our evaluation **we are looking for pathologists** that would like to contribute to this project. We would like to compare the performance of our method versus a group of pathologists. Both **experts and non-experts** on Gleason grading are invited to join.

Our dataset for this validation consists of **100 prostate biopsies**, scanned at 20x and stained with H&E. Each pathologist is asked to grade these 100 prostate biopsies, and to report the Gleason growth patterns and final Gleason Grade Group.

**Grading can be done from home** or any other place with internet access. The biopsies are available through an easy-to-use online viewer; no software is required to view the biopsies.
